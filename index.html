        Kulina's mission is to "serve the best meal with an outstanding customer experience at the lowest possible price every single day". We want to be customer's default meal option by providing quality product with on-time delivery. We help customers save time and money for each meal they get from us, so they can better spend it on other things that matter.
        <br><br>
        We took pride in being the first food tech startup to join "Google Launchpad Accelerator" in San Francisco, and the only one from Indonesia in winter 2018. Our startup is backed by the same inverstor who invested in Ele.me (China's unicorn food delivery startup).
        <br><br>
